# Systems Programming Projects
This repository contains solutions to systems programming assignments written in Python. Each assignment implements essential components of a SIC/XE assembler and related tools.

## Assignments Overview
1. **Assignment 1**: Symbol Table Implementation
2. **Assignment 2**: Operand Evaluation Module
3. **Assignment 3 & 4**: Two-Pass SIC/XE Assembler
4. **Assignment 5**: Linker/Loader for Object Programs
5. **Additional Files**: Miscellaneous resources and supporting materials.

## Structure
- `Assignment1/`: Symbol table management module.
- `Assignment2/`: Operand evaluation and expression handling.
- `Assignment3/`: Pass 1 of assembler.
- `Assignment4/`: Pass 2 of assembler.
- `Assignment5/`: Linker/loader program.


## How to Run
Each folder includes a README.md explaining how to execute the scripts and what files are needed.
